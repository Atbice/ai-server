# AI-SERVER

## Introduction
The journey began with our desire to experiment with training larger models. However, we quickly realized that such tasks would monopolize our computers, leaving no room for fun during our downtime. Both of us share a deep interest in hardware and building computers, which led Anton to suggest a creative solution.

## The Genesis
Anton proposed constructing a server specifically for model training after he had acquired a used Dell Precision 5600 a few years ago, which was otherwise just collecting dust. The initial plan was straightforward: purchase a used AI card, install it, and start running. This turned out to be easier said than done. Our research into which AI card to buy gave us a good sense of what we wanted.

## Early Challenges
In the meantime, the plan was to get the server running at Anton's house with an old standard GPU. After much trial and error, we successfully installed Proxmox, enabling remote access. Unfortunately, we then faced a significant challenge: the server was extremely loud! Anton's wife was particularly unhappy with this setup! :D But we're not ones to give up easily.

## Problem-Solving
We thought replacing the power supply unit (PSU) with a quieter one would be a simple solution. However, we encountered unexpected compatibility issues; servers and home computers use different types of PSUs, and Dell has its own standards, so no off-the-shelf PSU would fit our server chassis. Luckily, Robert had an extra-large chassis left over from a previous computer build, which seemed like the perfect fix to our problem. With determination, Robert transported this bulky behemoth by train and tram to Anton's place.

## Conclusion
Our story is a testament to innovation, teamwork, and resilience in the face of challenges. Stay tuned as we continue to evolve our AI server setup!
